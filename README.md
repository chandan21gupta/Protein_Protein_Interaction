# Protein_Protein_Interaction
## Machine learning models to detect any PPI between sars cov - 2 and human
This repository contains directories.

1) dataset - contains the raw sequence fasta files
2) extracted_datasets - final datasets after feature selection
3) old_code - codes used for eda and feature selection for previous submissions (may not be optimal to run by latest)
4) Saved_Files - Contains three subdirectories
          Results - confusion matrices, roc curve and metrics for all the models
          Train_Test_Data - datasets stored after feature selection
          models - optimal models stored for each algorithm.
5) src - contains latest source files used to train and test the models. These should be run to generate the results.

The documentation for each function made can be found in its definition in the file itself.
